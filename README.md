# short game design
We have a walkable map with enemies who we can attack to gain experience and level up our stats. Our combat
system will be turned based which will be 1 attack/move per turn. enemies can turn and attack as well. We have 
an end boss to fight in which we win? Our stats/weapons/armour will affect how combat goes.
